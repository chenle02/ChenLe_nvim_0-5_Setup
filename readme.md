# Transition from nvim 0.4 to 0.5+.
1. I have been inspired by https://vinversion.hashnode.dev/switching-from-neovim-04-to-05 to upgrade to nvim 0.5+.
2. Check out the [nvim lua guide](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide).
3. The telescope setup has been set up mostly following the great example by [whatsthatsmell](https://github.com/whatsthatsmell/dots); see his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQIJghSU9TU&t=336s).
4. The set up is particularly useful for typing latex.
