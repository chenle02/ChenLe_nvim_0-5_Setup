# Transition from nvim 0.4 to 0.5+.
1. I have been inspired by https://vinversion.hashnode.dev/switching-from-neovim-04-to-05 to upgrade to nvim 0.5
2. Check out the [nvim lua guide](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide)
3. The telescope setup has been followed by [whatsthatsmell](https://github.com/whatsthatsmell/dots)
